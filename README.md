## Guide for Contributors

The site uses a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This means that members of the community can edit the content of pages without having to learn how to code websites.

Each file with .md as its extension corresponds to a live page on the website.

The files are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ "Guide to Markdown") (the same system as Discord) and can be edited using the on-site Github editor. You can also write HTML directly in these files if that helps.

Please do make sure you provide titles for links and alt text for images, as these are a crucial part of making the site accessible.

Once you commit your changes, it will take Github a few minutes to update the live website.

### How do I add a news post?

There is [a very short reference on how to create blog posts on the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/ "Guide to making blog posts").
