## Guide for Contributors

The site uses a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This means that you can edit the content of pages without having to learn how to code websites.

Every file with .md as its extension corresponds to a live page on the website.

The files are written in [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) (the same system as Discord) and can be edited using the on-site Github editor.

Once you commit your changes it will take Github a few minutes to update the live website.

### How do I add a blog post?

There is [a very short reference on how to create blog posts on the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).
