The first rule of EIG is not to talk about <cite>Basements and Lizards</cite>. Itâ€™s fine and all, but there are plenty of other places to discourse about dragons.

The second rule of EIG is to make sure everyone is having fun. We have a code of conduct and use safety tools to help make this happen.

## Zine

In 2021 we crowdfunded a zine to share games, art and articles by members with the wider world. One of the things the zine funded was a website for our club. This is that website.

We would love for you to read, print, enjoy, translate, and generally consume our zine. [You can download it for free on itch.io](https://empowermint.itch.io/edinburgh-indie-gamers-zine-2021 "EIG Zine page")

## Join the Discord

You are invited to join our Discord if you:

- have attended an EIG event in the past,
- live in commuting distance of Edinburgh and intend to attend an EIG event in the future, 
- or live in the UK and are permanently housebound.

These restrictions are there to keep our community at a manageable size. If you would like to be start your own indie gaming community, we would be very excited to help you.
